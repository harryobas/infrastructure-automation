This directory holds automated inventory files containing the infrastructure
for the Raco Anisible Tutorial cluster. A variety of Ansible plugins exist
that will generate inventories for EC2 and other infrastructures.

Inventory files should be refreshed and committed/pushed for each mop where
one or more playbooks are intended to run.

Reusability is a major goal, please help to further that goal.
